\section{Usability Evaluation}
When designing the application usability has always been a key aspect.
We have chosen for a web application that ensures the client doesn't have to download or install any new software.
furthermore we tried to make the application as user friendly as possible.
This is done by making objects clickable and returning information about that specific object back to the user.

When the client goes to the site a standard login screen is promted.
After login in the client can go to patients to see their dashboard.
From there they can go to the patients page to chose a patient and start analysing it's DNA.
The dashboard doesn't contain a lot of information to make sure the client doesn't get lost.

In the mutations overview the client can click on a mutation to get more information about the gene it is in.
To show the mutations are clickable they change color when hovering over them with the mouse cursor.
