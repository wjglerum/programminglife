\section{Product Design}
	Product design plays an essential rol in making	a product user friendly and human centred. Our product mainly focusses on visualisation. Besides information retrieval the most important part is the way information is visualised and therefore design is important. Visualisations could give nice insights, but presenting this in a user friendly and enjoyable way is even better.
	
	One of the design aspects is the layout of the whole application. We tried to use clear distinction between navigation and application. Furthermore we use clean typography and clear navigation so users could easily find what they want. If there's an error message to show to the user, these are presented with meaningful design. E.g. an error message features a red background and an information message features a blue background.
	
	In the design we also tried to separate different parts of the application on one window. E.g. the mutation visualisation page features multiple components and every component has it's own heading.
