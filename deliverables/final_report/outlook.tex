GEVATT is developed in quite a short time. The course Contextproject lasts about ten weeks and in this ten weeks the team had to become skilled in the context, make accompanying documents	 and present the final product. So only a limited part of the time is actually used to develop the application. This means there's focussed on the main parts of the application and there are more functionalities that could be added later if development would continue. This chapter is about what functionalities  could be added.

One thing is exporting; this is currently not possible in the application. The found mutations and information from the VCF files are only visible in the application itself and require logging in. For a doctor, it might be handy to export some data and visualisations to make it easier to present them. E.g. it's easier for a doctor to show a print of visualisations to his patients than showing a screenshot of the application. It also might be handy to have the data exported to a spreadsheet format.
