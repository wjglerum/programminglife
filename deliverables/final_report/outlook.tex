GEVATT is developed in quite a short time. The course Contextproject lasts about ten weeks and in this ten weeks the team had to become skilled in the context, make accompanying documents	 and present the final product. So only a limited part of the time is actually used to develop the application. This means we've focussed on the main parts of the application and there are more functionalities that could be added later if development would continue. This chapter is about what functionalities  could be added.
