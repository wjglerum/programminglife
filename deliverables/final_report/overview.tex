The developed product, a secured web application, is built on de Play Framework. It contains several parts that work together to deliver a user friendly environment for the users to explore genetic information.

Starting with the basis, it's a secured web application where a user needs to login. After logging in some secured pages become accessible. Some other pages already are accessible before loggin in, e.g. the documentation and about pages.

The web framework and it's builtin securing module isn't developed by ourselves so we could focus on developing the context specific parts. This was mainly separable in three parts: analysing data, retrieval of relevant data of databases and visualising data.

Analysing the data is done by processing the VCF file and detecting mutations. The outcomes of the processing is used in the visualisation. At both of these parts there's information used given by some databases. The information was used the get more information about mutations and find relations between several mutations.
