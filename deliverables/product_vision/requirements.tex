\section{Requirements}
The requirements for our application can be categorized into the following two groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Functional requirements} are requirements that describe what a system should do.
\item \textbf{Non-functional requirements} are requirements that describe how a system should do it.
\end{itemize}
Since we are using the scrum development cycle, we expect that these requirements will be updated during the project.  

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a patient to our database 
\item Upload a VCF file that is linked to a patient
\item Analyse a VCF file, look for known disease mutations
\item Save the information of a certain patient
\item Remove a patient

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Run the application from a client that has at least a resolution with 768 pixels in width.
\item When a new client (and thus a new VCF file) has been added, the program should be able to analyse this data and return a decent report within 10 minutes. 
\end{itemize} \newpage
