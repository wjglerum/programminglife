\section*{Abstract}
This is the product vision for the Programming Live Contextproject, a second year course from Computer Science at TU Delft.
We will develop a tool for genetic biologist to determine the diseases of a person by analyzing DNA. This tool will visualize the mutations, trio data and gene interaction.
The product will be intuitive to use and be able to handle existing data to compare the results to.
The goal is to produce easier to use software then at hand and do this in a short fixed timeframe.
