\section{Platforms}
As mentioned in our previous section, our program will be built as a web application. Thanks to this, we will be able to run our program from any client that is able to run a website. In our design, however, we realized that our users will never want to use our application for a device like a mobile phone. With this in mind, we optimized the design for devices with a minimum width of 768 pixels, this is large enough for a tablet but too big for a mobile phone.
