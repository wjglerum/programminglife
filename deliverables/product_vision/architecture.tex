\section{Architecture}
Our product will be a web application. This gives us a big advantage: we will be able to use the computational power of a server, and let our user use the program from a device that doesn't have a lot of computing power. Besides this advantage, we will also be able to let the user run our program without installing it on his or her device. 

Our web application will be built in the play framework. This is an open source web application framework that is written in Scala and Java, and which follows the model-view-controller architectural pattern. This application will run on a server, and will serve the client a website. This website will be dynamic thanks to JavaScript and Ajax. 

Since our web application needs to run queries from multiple servers, we are going to implement the possibility of executing queries parallel. This will result in a better performance.
