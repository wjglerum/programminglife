\section*{Note}
Mathijs managed to get Spring working with maven, had some problems with the pom-file, but once it was working, made a basic login page and a file upload page.\\
Jasper and Willem Jan tried getting Spring to work, but everything failed to work. They also tried Typesave activator for Play, which was a beautiful application, but had terrible integration with Maven. Then tried Spring again, but to no avail. After this they tried the Play framework and finally succeeded in making a few basic pages.
