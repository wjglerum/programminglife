\hline \hline

A user wants to have an overview of mutations per patient 
& Look up homozygote SNPs & 6 & Mathijs \& Ruben & 10 hours & Yes & Done. Took some time to figure out how to get other kind of information. \\
& Show relevant information per chromosome in overview visualization & 6 & Mathijs & 5 hours & Yes & There's a separate overview per chromosome now. \\
& Implement the XY/XX chromo- some & 10 & Mathijs & 10 hours & Done & Mathijs implemented the functionality. Option added in form for adding a patient to indicate if the patient is male or female.\\
\hline

A user wants to view links between genes and proteins related to a mutation 
& Show multiple mutations per graph & 6 & Robbert \&Jasper & 10 hours & Yes & Quite hard to get information quickly. Finally made the processing of finding related mutations based on proteins after uploading a file. Connections are saved in the database so viewing the graphs stays quick. \\
\hline
A user looks at an overview of the location of a mutation & Look if other genes are near the starting point of a mutation & 6 & Willem Jan & 12 hours & Yes & Willem Jan updated the whole visualisation with 20 genes and there locations indicated by horizontal bars. \\
& Show neighbouring mutations & 6 & Willem Jan & 5 hours & Yes & See previous point. \\
\hline

Database testing 
& Give proper errors when database fails & 4 & - & - & No & Skipped this due to time considerations. \\
\hline

A user logs in and views basic information 
& Optimize dashboard information & 2 & Jasper & 4 hours & Yes & Done, removed unused pages and merged to the dashboard. Dashboard got an update. \\

Deliverables
& Scrum reflection 5 week 9 & 2 & Jasper & 1 hour & Yes & None.\\
& Final Report Draft & 5 & Jasper \& Mathijs \& Willem Jan & 15 hours & Yes & Mathijs dit HCI chapter, Willem Jan evaluation. Jasper made other chapters and putter things together. \\
& Architecture Design Draft 2 & 5 & Ruben & 5 hours & Yes & Most of feedback was already processed. \\

\section*{General Reflection}
Last week with a lot of finishing touches. Some little extra features were added like background processing of the VCF files. All visualisations are finished and we have a working product. Still some minor issues with database connections but managed to get it working.

Final report just toke some time but was made. EAD had a bit less work because some earlier feedback was already processed. \\
