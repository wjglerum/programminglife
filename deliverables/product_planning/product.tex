\subsection{High-level product backlog}
This section describes the desired features of the application according to the MoSCoW method \cite{brennan2009guide}. Categorized into four groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Must haves} describe requirements that must be statisfied in the final solution
\item \textbf{Should haves} describe high-priority requirements that should be included if possible
\item \textbf{Could haves} describe requirements that are considered desirable but not necessary.
\item \textbf{Would haves} describe requirements that stakeholders have agreed will not be implemented in the solution, but could be added in the future.
\end{itemize}
