First version with estimates and prioritized user stories.
		\subsection{User stories of features}
A child has an illness, while the parents do not. 
A doctor wants to use our product to find out wether a mutation of a particular gene may be the cause of this disease. 
For this, he has the following method: 

The doctor chooses a VCF file of the parents and the child to analyze. 
He gets a visualization where he can see what mutations there are in the DNA of the child and whether the locations of these mutations have been associated with the illness of the child. 
The doctor uses the visualization to deduce what changes may be the cause of the disease.
		\subsection{Initial release plan}
The general roadmap of our product will be as below:

\subsubsection*{sprint 1}
Basic setup of framework, read VCF files and connect to database.

\subsubsection*{sprint 2}
Make usefull query's for the database and find all mutations in the VCF file.

\subsubsection*{sprint 3}
Retrieve data from the database assosieted with the mutations found in the VCF file and make a visualisation of the mutations.

\subsubsection*{sprint 4}
Visualize the found mutations and possible connections with genes associeted with a dissease.

\subsubsection*{sprint 5}
Improve usability of the product.

\subsubsection*{sprint 6}
Improve visualisations.

\subsubsection*{sprint 7}
Finish report and presentation.
