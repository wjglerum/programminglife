This section describes when a feature is really done and ready to be integrated in the system. We will define this for a feature, sprint and end product.

A feature is finished when it is fully tested and the code is accepted by other developers.
These test should done with JUnit and the code coverage should be high enough.
Furthermore the code must be fully documented with JavaDoc and should match the rules from CheckStyle.

A sprint is finished when the whole application is tested and approved, just like a feature. However the continuous integration system should also accept the build. Next the developers and users will test the system by hand to check for bugs.

The end product is finished if all the Should haves and Could haves are implemented and tested as described above, because only the should haves give a very basic application. The product should have the looks and feels approved by the stakeholders, they should be happy with the product.

Furthermore in addition to all this the code should be well documented, tested, style checked and integrated. This will all be evaluated by the SIG (Software Inprovement Group) and should be improved after the first check.
