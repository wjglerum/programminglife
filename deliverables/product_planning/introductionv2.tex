We are group two of the Programming Live Contextproject, a second year course of Computer Science at Delft University of Technology. We will develop a tool for clinical geneticists, which will help to determine the diseases of a person by analyzing their DNA. The name of our tool is GEVATT, which is an abbreviation for GEnetic Variations Analyzer Through Triodata. This tool will visualize the mutations in DNA, triodata and gene interaction. The product will be intuitive to use and will be able to handle existing data to compare the results to. The goal is to develop easier to use software than currently at hand within a fixed time frame.
