\section{What is the target timeframe and budget to develop and launch the product?}
The timeframe for this project is seven weeks, with a fixed deadline on the 26th of June.
As this is a schoolproject we should finish the product before the deadline as we cannot continue the project after this date.
Furthermore there is not a real budget for this project, again because this is a schoolproject, however each team member will receive 10 ECTS for this course.
