\section{How does the product compare against existing products, both from competitors and the same company? What are the products unique selling points?}
There are no products to compare with from the same company, though several other product for DNA visualization have been made.
Existing products like cBioPortal \cite{cbio} and other software can either show relations between genes, or visualize specific genomic variants. %list more software
For example Circos \cite{circos} visualizes data in a circular layout, useful for exploring relationships between objects.


Our product will focus on genomic variants at different locations.
The product will visualize and assist in the interpretation of genomic variants on different genomes.
The focus will be on trio data: genes of parents and children, and gene interactions: genes on different locations of the genome affecting the same attribute.
