We are group two of the Programming Live Contextproject, a second year course from Computer Science at Delft University of Technology. We will develop a tool for clinical geneticists, that will help to determine the diseases of a person by analysing their DNA. The name of our tool is GEVATT, which is a abbreviation for GEnetic Variations Analyzer Through Triodata. This tool will visualize the mutations, trio data and gene interaction. The product will be intuitive to use and will be able to handle existing data to compare the results to. The goal is to produce easier to use software then at hand and do this in a short fixed time frame.
